## General info
I love to create, plan and build concepts. One of my favorite tools is whiteboard and loads of colorfull markers. Unfortunatly, this solution has some issues: it's big and heavy, difficult to save results (photo) and load, uneditable. I haven't found as good program as whiteboard but without these drawbacks. This Innoter is going to be the best medicine for my creators soul.

Innoter will interprete user drawings and create editable objects as: line, arrows, rectangle, ellipse, tables, etc.
